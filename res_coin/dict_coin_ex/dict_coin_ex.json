Coincheck security features include storage of customer assets in cold wallets, working with information security firms and two-factor authentication for users.\n\nOn Jan. 26, 2018, $530 million worth of NEM (XEM) tokens were stolen in a hack of the exchange. This was due to Coincheck being short staffed and suffering technical difficulties, resulting in poor security practices. The stolen XEM tokens were stored in a [hot wallet](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hot-wallet), which is connected to the internet, instead of an offline [cold wallet](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/cold-wallet), which is standard industry practice.

Since YetiSwap is built on Avalanche, it enables users to swap assets while enjoying sub-second transaction finality and transaction fees as low as a few cents. Oftentimes, trades on YetiSwap will feel as fast as trades on centralized exchanges. Second, beyond the significant performance upgrades to the technical status quo.\r\nUsers of existing AMMs, such as Pangolin, Uniswap, and Sushiswap, are already familiar with their mechanism of action. Therefore, the rest of this post does not discuss how YetiSwap achieves its trading capabilities.

Besides [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), Paraswap also supports [Polygon](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/), [Binance Smart Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/) and [Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/).\n\nIn essence, Paraswap acts as the intermediary between users and various DeFi services, collating [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) from more than 20 decentralized exchanges to bring all these possibilities into a single portal for users’ convenience.\n\n\n## What Is Paraswap?\n\nParaSwap is a DeFi-based exchange portal that is user-friendly and designed with the user’s convenience in mind.\n\nEach Paraswap transaction shows the user a helpful summary of their transaction, including the estimated cost, price impact and minimum received. Also shown are the routing details to help users understand the path their tokens have taken and minimize confusion. \n\nOne important thing to note is that Paraswap exchanges do not incur any additional fees to the user and users only need to pay for [gas fees](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas), as with any DeFi exchange. \n\nParaswap returns the optimal route and effective price to the end-user through a series of routing through its internal mechanisms. Once a user taps into the exchange, Paraswap finds the best rate using a pricing aggregator that fetches off-chain pricing and then performs the swap using a [smart contract](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) to deposit the fee into a fee wallet. This may sometimes involve breaking a single order into several exchanges if that is the most price-efficient way of conducting the swap. \n\nThis mechanism eliminates the need for users to compare prices and instead frees up their time to focus on optimizing their trading strategy or educating themselves on the cryptocurrency space, like using [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/).\n\nThe “Swap \u0026 Transfer” function allows users to easily send tokens to other users at any address, facilitating cross-party exchanges.\n\n\n# How Does Paraswap Work?\n\nUsing ParaSwap begins with an Ethereum wallet, which is all a user needs in order to make use of the exchange.\n\nTo set up an account, a user can use the Paraswap app on a browser or download the Paraswap app. They can then use a [hot wallet](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/10-best-crypto-hot-wallets-for-beginners), like MetaMask, or a [cold wallet](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/best-crypto-cold-wallets), like the Ledger Nano. Users need to then create an Ethereum account on Ledger Live. In Ledger Live, there is a Swap tab where a user needs to select Paraswap as the provider.\n\nFrom here, the user can select the Ethereum account they want to use as well as the tokens they want to swap. The last step is verifying the swap information on their Ledger hardware wallet. \n\n\n# What Makes Paraswap Unique?\n\nParaswap is unique firstly in that it allows large transfers of Ethereum to take place, with the transfers most effective when they exceed 15 ETH. Paraswap also allows for transfers involving interactions with a number of DeFi protocols.\n\nAnother unique feature of Paraswap is that it allows users to aggregate their DeFi exchanges and do the swaps within one single transaction, optimizing gas fees. \n\nWhile Ethereum is the main type of token exchanged on Paraswap, the exchange also allows for the payment of different types of currencies, saving a lot of steps for users.",

        "description": "## What Is ViperSwap?\r\n\r\nViperSwap is an automated market maker (AMM), a decentralized exchange (DEX) and DeFi protocol that allows users to exchange tokens, provide liquidity and earn trading fees.\r\n\r\nThe DEX launched March 8th, 2021 and runs on Harmony's blockchain - making it one of the fastest and cheapest DEX:es in existence.\r\n\r\nViperSwap is based on a mashup of Uniswap and SushiSwap smart contracts and features an automated market maker model where users trade against liquidity pools.\r\n\r\nThe pool liquidity is deposited by users who want to earn trading fees as well as staking rewards for providing the liquidity. After depositing funds the users earn a liquidity provider (LP) token called VENOM-LP which can be staked to earn additional rewards besides trading fees.\r\n\r\nThe LP token is also used by users to reclaim their initial provided capital plus earned trading fees.\r\n\r\n## What Makes ViperSwap Unique?\r\n\r\nViperSwap takes advantage of Harmony's 2-second finality and extremely low transaction fees to offer one of the fastest and cheapest DEX:es in existence right now.\r\n\r\nA regular swap transaction on ViperSwap typically costs around $0.0000000015 - making the platform a viable option for everyone since users don't have to pay $10, $20 or even $100 to perform a single swap.\r\n\r\nViperSwap is governed by the VIPER governance token which is HRC-20 token awarded to liquidity providers staking their LP tokens on the platform.\r\n\r\nThe VIPER token features a unique lockup system designed to incentivize long-term protocol participation with the explicit goal of rewarding early and loyal liquidity providers. The token is used for both protocol governance as well as incentivizing liquidity providers.\r\n\r\nSwaps on ViperSwap follow a similar fee model as Uniswap and Sushiswap: every trade carries a 0.3% fee.\r\n\r\nViperSwap features a fee-sharing system called the \"ViperPit\" where 0.1% of the 0.3% fee (1/3rd) is distributed to users staking the VIPER token in the ViperPit single-asset staking pool. This is 50% more than what is awarded to stakers in e.g. SushiSwap (which rewards stakers with 1/6th of trading fees).\r\n\r\nIn summary:\r\n\r\n* Super fast DEX\r\n* Insanely low swap fees (as low as $0.0000000015!)\r\n* Attractive fee sharing mechanism rewarding singe-asset stakers 1/3rd of all generated trading fees",

        "description": "Automated market makers (AMMs) are part of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. They allow digital assets to be traded in a permissionless and automatic way by using liquidity pools rather than a traditional market of buyers and sellers. AMM users supply liquidity pools with crypto tokens, whose prices are determined by a constant mathematical formula. Liquidity pools can be optimized for different purposes, and are proving to be an important instrument in the DeFi ecosystem.\r\n\r\nNow, a decentralized exchange (DEX) is a peer-to-peer (p2p) online service that allows direct cryptocurrency transactions between two interested parties. Decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges are aimed at solving problems that are inherent in centralized exchanges. They create p2p markets directly on the blockchain, which allows traders to independently store and operating funds. Users of such exchanges can make transactions with cryptocurrency directly between each other — i.e., without third-party involvement.\r\n\r\nSo, what about CoinSwap Space? Founded on April 2021, CoinSwap Space is a decentralized exchange or DEX created for swapping BEP20 tokens on the Binance Smart Chain. CoinSwap Space uses an automated market maker (AMM) model where users can trade against a liquidity pool. Those pools are filled with users’ funds. They deposit them into the pool, receiving liquidity provider (or LP) tokens in exchange. Now, they can use those tokens to reclaim their share, plus a portion of the trading fees. \r\n\r\nCoinSwap Space’s vision is to create a strong foundation for the community by giving them incentives in exchange for their support of the AMM model. Creating an advanced ecosystem for automated liquidity provisioned on the Binance Smart Chain.\r\n\r\nWho is our target? Our main target is consumers that are avoiding the high gas fees of Ethereum Blockchain. We are also aiming to become the best platform that you can use that operates in the AMM model of BSC.\r\n\r\nCoinSwap Space also allows users to farm additional tokens that are listed on the yield farming pool. On the farm, users can deposit LP tokens, staking them in a process that rewards users with CSS tokens. Users can stake those CSS tokens to receive CSSl, which will have further functionality as a governance and utility token.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the CoinSwap Space platform has the ability to launch new pools, as it is an automated market maker that utilizes smart routing that gives its clients the best swapping rate, slippage, and price impact available. \r\n\r\nThe liquidity provided to the swap comes from Liquidity Providers (\"LPs\") who stake their tokens in \"Pools\". In exchange for this, they get CS-LP (CoinSwap-LiquidityProvider) tokens, which can also be staked to earn CSS tokens in the \"farm.\"\r\n\r\nIf you need to know more about CoinSwap Space, more information is available at https://doc.coinswap.space/.",

        "description": "What is KSwap Finance (KST) \r\n\r\nKSwap Finance (https://kswap.finance) is a decentralized trading platform deployed on OKExChain on July 29, 2021.  Aiming at a top DEX on OKExChain, KSwap Finance enables the seamless transferring of digital currencies among users via a well-developed automatic maker algorithm (AMM). It is also the first to launch products such as KUniverse and KStarter to explore more ways to play and meet the needs of more users.\r\n\r\nKSwap Finance always attaches particular high importance to platform security and functionalities. Its products have been demonstrated to be well-functioned on the test net. Since its launch on the test net as early as February (2021), KSwap Finance has drawn heightened interests from blockchain communities. Only in April, KSwap grows terrifically, with an over 500% increase in total liquidity. An increasing influx of users has chosen to test various mature and new features on Kswap Finance to be better positioned for the official reception of OkExChain.\r\n\r\nWhat makes KSwap Finance different from other AMM-based decentralized changes? \r\n\r\nKSwap Finance is integrated with a marketplace for celestial body-themed non-fungible tokens (NFT), KUniverse. Unlike traditional NFTs that only have collector and game values, KUniverse deeply integrates KSwap's trading and bonus mechanisms, allowing KUniverse NFT holders to participate in a fixed bonus pool for KSwap's transaction fees to receive rewards. \r\n\r\nKUniverse issues a total of 20,000 mystery boxes in which there is a card representing celestial bodies such as Earth, Mars, etc. However, these celestial-themed cards are not equally distributed. Cards featuring different celestial bodies are assigned one of the seven levels of weights. Cards with higher weights are more scarce, and therefore more valuable than those with lower ranks. \r\nTrading in the marketplace. A user may trade his/her NFT assets with different NFT cards by selling in the market. This comes with a great level of flexibility, meaning a user may set whatever price he/she deems reasonable.\r\n\r\nStaking for rewards. KSwap Finance will dedicate a significant amount of the total supply of the KST into a dividend pool. In order to reap as high KST rewards as possible, a user may want to stake NFT cards with higher weights. The weights are used by the pool's algorithm to determine what portion of total rewards out of each block will be given to the user. Another entertaining aspect is that if a user collects a series of NFT cards covering all of the seven levels, the user can enjoy as high as 44% additional bonus when all the cards are stacked in the dividend pool. This design uniquely benefits NFT holders, as by staking their assets they can enjoy passive income along the time.",
